## Questions

1. What is the difference between `new` and `create` for a model?
  New doesn't save while create does.
2. What command followed after with `Cat.new` will emulate the same behavior as `Cat.create`?
  Cat.save
3. What is the default integer column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?
  Each variable has an id.
4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "Kira" in the database?
  Cat.create(:name => 'Kira')
5. How did you like this homework in comparison with the previous homeworks?
  It was a lot harder. I think a video of the demo would've been helpful because without verbal explanations of what the reasoning behind everything is, I'm just googling what every line does.
